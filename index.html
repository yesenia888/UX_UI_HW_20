            <p class="intro"> Our mission as UX/UI Designers was to understand users' goals, perspectives, and expectations of the 
                website in order for us to redesign it. With our final results we planned to make it more accessible and make important
                 information easy to locate.</p>

        <section id="challenge">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p> Users struggle to navigate the site and locate key information, which results in frustration and disengagement. 
                Additionally, the websites mission statement is not clearly communicated which leads to confusion about D.A.R.E 
                and its initiatives. These problems make it hard for the organization to effectively convey their message and fulfill 
                its educational mission</p>
        </section>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>We Predict that by redesigning the website to feature a more intuitive navigation structure that will help 
                incorporate user-centered content and all around improving the visual design for better accessibility and engagement, 
                Thus we will hopefully increase user satisfaction and engagement</p>
        </section>

        <section id="results">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>We conducted a couple of interviews including some with the D.A.R.E stakeholders. 
                We also distributed surveys to website users these were the results. We discovered that the main issues were the 
                homepage is cluttered, and the design itself is not very appealing</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p> We discovered that the main issues were the 
                homepage is cluttered, and the design itself is not very appealing. We would like to implement a contact page, a 
                virtual assistant and have an option to become a member and have a log in section.</p>
